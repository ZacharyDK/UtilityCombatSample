EULA:

This plugin is subject to same EULA as Epic's Paragon assets, the general UE4 EULA, and the EULA from using assets downloaded from the Unreal Engine Market place.

This plugin is only for Unreal Engine users. If you don't use Unreal, the most you can do read the source code. 

This plugin contains animations from Paragon assets retargeted to the manniquin. Do not use these animations for anything other than an Unreal project. 

Free, have fun.
